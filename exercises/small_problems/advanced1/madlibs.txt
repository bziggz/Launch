A vacation is when you take a trip to some ADJECTIVE place with your

ADJECTIVE family. Usually you go to some place that is near a/an

NOUN or up on a/an NOUN. A good vacation place is one where you

can ride PLURAL_NOUN or play GAME or go hunting for PLURAL_NOUN.

I like to spend my time ING_VERB or ING_VERB. When parents go on 

vacation, they spend their time eating three PLURAL_NOUN a day. Last summer

my little brother fell in a/an NOUN and got poison PLANT all over 

his BODY_PART.
