1)  10.times { |x| puts "The Flintstones Rock!".rjust(x += 21) }
    **10.times { |num| puts (" " * num) + "The Flintstones Rock!" }

2)  TypeError - fixnum into string
    puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2).to_s
    puts "the value of 40 + 2 is #{(40 + 2)}"

3)  def factors(number)
      divisor = number
      factors = []
      while divisor > 0 do
        factors << number / divisor if number % divisor == 0
        divisor -= 1
      end
      factors
    end

    1) that expression determines if the divisor is a factor or not
    2) makes sure the return is the factors array

4)  rolling_buffer1 will mutate the call argument
    rolling_buffer2 will return the modified array, but not alter the original

5)  limit isn't accessible within the method's scope.
    either declare the limit within the method, or pass it in as a third parameter/argument

6)  34

7)  yes. index assignment is mutating

8)  rps(rps(rps("rock", "paper"), rps("rock", "scissors")), "rock") becomes
    rps(rps("paper", "rock"), "rock")                               becomes
    rps("paper", "rock")                                            resolves
    "paper"

9)  "no"
