1) 7, integers are immutable, and inner scope doesn't affect outer local variable

2) 7, the block reads a as the parameter and argument, not the outer variable

3) 7, a is still passed in only as an argument, and not mutated outside the block

4) Xy_z, strings are mutable objects, and the method [] is a destructive method

5) Xyzzy, the method merely reassigns the string, which doesn't mutate the outer value

6) undefined local variable - since the outer a is not accessible within the block

7) 3, method invocation can access and mutate outer scope, while method definition cannot

8) undefined local variabl - the a assigned within the method isn't accessible outside the method

9) 7, the a within the method is a parameter, not the accessing of the outer variable a

10) error - the variable a, which is accessible w/in the method invocation, is not accessible w/in the surrounding method definition.
