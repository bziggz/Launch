# I like ruby-doc.com due to familiarity thanks to this course. 

# I like docs.ruby-lang.org because they do a little bit more layman-level
#   explanation. I can see the "Common Gotchas" sections being very helpful

# I like stack overflow for quick, to-the-point, sometimes creative answers,
# and because it helps to know other people have the same kinds of issues.
